## Introduction
The portfolio is the current website that showcases my current work. It is built using Next.js hosted on Vercel. The portfolio theme embodies a coastal vibe – relaxed, beachy, and sunlit.

## Challenges:
Learning Three.js library was more challenging than anticipated and the steep learning curve. I naively thought that elementary understanding of linear algebra and geometry would suffice, but boy was I wrong. It required a deep understanding of the 3D coordinate systems, scene composition, and its spatial reasoning in the digital space. Adding more complexity to the mix, when using custom shaders to deeper level of control to allow better visual effects, it required using programs written in [GLSL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language)

Realizing the steep learning curve, I opted for a more practical approach, using Blender to create simpler low-poly models with minimal triangles. Also, I took the challenge to create a texture and shape of a [cloud written in GLSL](https://github.com/paul-cho-39/portfolio/tree/master/src/app/library/shaders).

## Learning and Development
Throughout the development of the portfolio website, I gained insights that expanded both my understanding of website design and better ability to utilize animation libraries. This can be summarized in the following key areas:
-   **Thematic Design Implementation**: This project highlighted the importance of integrating broader concepts –like having theme in mind - into website design. Choosing a coastal vibe theme was more than a stylistic decision; it served as a blueprint for building and developing components, color schemes, typography, and user interface elements. This thematic approach not only simplified the development process, but also ensured a more intuitive user experience that reflects the theme.
-   **Animation Libraries**: Learning and integrating third-party animation libraries like Three.js, React-Three-Fiber, and Framer Motion was instrumental in enhancing the website. Adding a moderation of animation made the website more interactive, brought it to life, and provided context to page behavior, which are all crucial for improving user experience and engagement. However, it does come with challenges - where I am still continuously learning – such as knowing when, where, and how to include animations, as well as optimizing the performance without overwhelming the user experience.
