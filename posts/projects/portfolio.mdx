## Introduction
The portfolio is the current website that showcases my current work. It is built using Next.js, version 13.4. The portfolio theme embodies a coastal vibe – relaxed, beachy, and sunlit atmosphere. The colors are represented here:  [display the color here]. 
Challenges:
Learning Three.js library was more challenging than anticipated and the steep learning curve. I naively thought that elementary understanding of linear algebra and geometry would suffice, but boy was I wrong. It required a deep understanding of the 3D coordinate systems, scene composition, and its spatial reasoning in the digital space. And further adding complexity to the mix, when using custom shaders to deeper level of control to allow better visual effects, it required using programs written in GLSL [link]
Realizing the steep learning curve, I opted for a more practical approach, using Blender to create simpler low-poly models with minimal triangles. 

## Learning and Development
From this project, I learned animation and understanding models where I:
-	Building websites based on bigger ideas like theme
-	~~Using~~ third-party libraries like Three.js, React-Three-Fiber, and Framer Motion.
-	Testing the new [Next.js]!(https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration){: .preview-link} ‘app’ directory
