###[See this website live!](https://google-books-library.vercel.app/)
This is a full-stack project built using Next.js and hosted on Vercel. It integrates Google Books API and New York Times API to deliver real-time data on an extensive range of books. 

## Key Features
-	It features full CRUDs applications enabling users to create, add, and update books and rating of a book, and browsing books - by categories and weekly popular list from New York Times. 
-	Powered by PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, for enhancing type safety and streamlining the development flow.
-	Secure authentication using [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/v3/adapters/prisma).
-	Responsive design, styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Challenges
In this project, two challenges were at the forefront: managing client-side caching and implementing [optimistic updates](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/optimistic-updates). React Query was instrumental in addressing the two challenges, which significantly simplified the process.

#### Caching
The primary issue I faced was adhering to API rate limits while minimizing data loading times. I tried different methods for loading the data more quickly like server-side rendering to pre-render data. However, this did not solve the problem as it fetched the data on each page reload. This method would pose serious problems because it would exhaust the API rate limit, which would crash the page rendered using the API.

To resolve this, I integrated [static generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation) coupled with react-query’s caching features and throttling each request to Google Books.

For instance, when routed to ```/search ``` and searching for a book titled, “react”, would prompt a cache check with a relevant key. The application would request data from Google Books only if it wasn't already cached. Subsequently, the following response would be stored in [‘QueryCache’]( https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/QueryCache).

The data is now cached in the browser's memory. If the user navigates from the current path, ```/search ```, to ```books/[bookId]```, it checks the cache and serves the data from the cache instead of making another API request, which would lead to faster page rendering and reduced API load.

#### Optimistic Updates

Another critical aspect of this project was handling optimistic updates. The challenge here was not just about maintaining a responsive and intuitive interface, but also about ensuring the integrity and consistency of data in real-time in features like updating users' library or rating book ratings. The idea here is before the server responds users' action, the client side will optimistically handle this and reflect the changes in the state.

The implementation of optimistic updates involved four key considerations:
1. **Immediate Feedback**: Provide user feedback when a user initiates an action.
2. **State Update**: Updates the client-side state to reflect the expected result. 
3. **Rollback**: Include rollback mechanism to gracefully revert to its previous state.
4. **Cache Invalidation**: Cache invalidation to reflect the new state of the data.

There is one consideration that should be handled, which is handling concurrent updates. Concurrent updates from multiple users may present a more complex challenge. The discrepencies that may arise from such scenarios require a more sophisticated strategy.

## What I have learned
Through this project, I have honed my skills in:
-	Advanced use of react-query, including caching strategies, optimistic updates, and complex querying techniques 
-	Effective utilization of third-party APIs and understanding it to write scalable codes and [improve performance]( https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/performance). 
-	Better understanding of Next.js framework (```/pages```) directory
-	Implementing authentication and OAuth.
