# Biography

## My Story
Hello! My name is Paul. I am a self-taught developer. Up until the pandemic, I did not know much about software, but had a fascination and curiosity around it. I took the first step and first ventured with being acquainted with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and fundamental concepts of programming. I have gradually expanded my expertise to various languages and technologies, exploring the intricacies of both web and app development.

One of my early ambitions was to deploy a mobile app using the cross-platform library, React-Native, to the Google Play Store. The application aimed to build features that can track, record users reading time (GitHub link), create catalogs and organize notes, and create reading planners ([Read more here](http://localhost:3000/projects/bookmarker)). Spoiler alert – it was not entirely a success, and I absolutely underestimated the project, but this experience was pivotal in my growth as a developer. It involved over 10,000 lines of code and taught me that success requires more than just determination and relentless commitment. By and large, I learned the importance of careful planning, choosing the proper technologies, structuring files, and organizing codes, and documenting so that future me can understand when debugging or refactoring. 

## Current
Fast forward to today, I am transitioning from exploring and learning to actively contributing within the industry. In my recent project, I had hands-on experience with caching mechanisms, specifically client-side caching using react-query as well as offline caching strategies employing Realm and MongoDB. My experience in development of applications from scratch has provided me solid foundation in authentication, third-party APIs, state management, routing, performance optimization and even designing RESTful and graph-based data architectures. Currently, my focus is working on working with WebSocket and deepening my expertise in integrating these applications with AWS.

## Personal
I’m all about diving headfirst into challenges and aiming high! It’s not about ticking boxes or learning new tech skills. For me, every mistake is a chance to grow a little more, both as a developer and as a person. Whether navigating the complexities of a new project or figuring out life, I’m learning and evolving; in a way, it is kind of my personal mantra! 

When I'm not coding, you can find me lost in the pages of a good book, staying active at the gym or outdoors, catching up on my favorite sports, comedies, and films, soaking in the beauty of nature, or diving into meaningful conversations.

If you have an exciting project in mind for collaboration or freelancing opportunities, I’d love to hear from you! If not, drop by and say hello.
